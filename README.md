# Initial design

- Use a very basic OS
	- Processes have different priorities
	- Processes live until they are deleted
	- Processes have meaningful, unique names
	- Processes have the following stages:
		- Init
		- Run
		- End
	- Priority queue of processes to be processed.  Bump priority when processes haven't been run
	- We'll need a few processes to run permanently.
		- Update rooms
		- Update empire
	- Examples of processes:
		- Room process is running for each room.  
			-Room process has a conditions under which to ensures sub-processes.  
			- It ensures the manageLayout() process if the room is claimed.
			- manageLayout() is constantly checking what level the room is, and ensures it has subprocesses for all buildings.  When it spawns them, give them a position
				-process manageLayout() ensures process manageBuilders(thisRoom):
					-ensures a number and size of builders based upon the state of the room
				-process manageLayout() ensures process manageLinks(thisRoom)
					-manageLinks(thisRoom) ensures the following processes exist:
						- One process for each link that could exist in the room.  When spawning this process, ensure it has a position.
						- One process for controlling link transfers
- Completely autonomous
- Good logging
- Good visual displays
